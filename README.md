# gender_from_face

This is a Machine Learning project which recognizes gender from a image. The accuracy i got is 93%.

The dataset used is relatively small , so the accuracy can be improved by adding more images in the test and the training sets.

Convolutional neural network has been used of Deep learning to train this model. 

The coding has been done in python.

As a sample to predict a new image as a male or female a \single_prediction folder contains a image(one.jpg) which was used to check if the model works correctly or not.
